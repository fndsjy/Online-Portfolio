                I am obsessed with organization. I want to know every possible way to order items and I am constantly looking for different methods to help streamline my life and work. I have a strong desire to work more effectively and efficiently, and being extremely organized is one of the best methods. I recently read a book about minimalist living and I found that when I applied those ideals to my workspace, my productivity increased immensely. I could communicate with multiple clients more rapidly daily, and I had the answers to important questions ready when asked.
